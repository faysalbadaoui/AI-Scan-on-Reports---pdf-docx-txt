**AI-Scan-CLI** is a sophisticated, offline command-line tool designed to analyze documents (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) and detect text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude.

Unlike web-based detectors, this tool runs **locally on your machine** using Hugging Face Transformers. No data is uploaded to the cloud, ensuring complete privacy for sensitive documents.

## ✨ Features

* **📄 Multi-Format Support:** Natively reads and extracts text from PDF, Word (DOCX), and plain Text files.
* **🔍 Granular Analysis:** Splits documents into logical segments (paragraphs) to detect "mixed" content (human text edited with AI).
* **📊 Visual Dashboard:** Features a beautiful CLI interface using [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), including progress bars, confidence tables, and color-coded verdicts.
* **🔒 Privacy First:** Uses a local BERT/RoBERTa model. Your files never leave your computer.
* **🚀 Hardware Accelerated:** Automatically detects CUDA (NVIDIA) or MPS (Mac) for faster inference.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Set up Virtual Environment (Windows PowerShell) (optional) and install dependencies
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

# Install libraries
pip install torch transformers pdfplumber python-docx rich
```

## 🚀 Usage
### Run the script by pointing it to any document file on your computer.

```bash
python ai_scan.py "path/to/your/document.pdf"
```

## 🧠 How It Works
This tool utilizes the RoBERTa-base-openai-detector (or similar fine-tuned models) from Hugging Face. It analyzes text based on:

Perplexity: How "surprised" the model is by the next word. (LLMs are very predictable/low perplexity).

Burstiness: The variation in sentence structure. (Humans vary widely; LLMs are monotonous).

The script breaks the document into chunks (approx 512 tokens), analyzes them individually, and aggregates a weighted score to determine the final percentage.
